## Problem Description
As we all know nowadays there have been huge set up of industries across the country from which several types of gases emits like SO2, NO2, etc  and for that  the air that we inhale have been polluted in several parts of the country.
So for that we have designed an app that takes the value of certain states and using that value our Ai Ml algorithm predicts the air quality index of that particular area based on the values that we have or the user given as an input.The outcome along with the predictions shows that what measures you can take to keep yourself healthy.

## How can technology help?
Our Android app will take your city data like air qulity and elements like NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, NH<sub>3</sub>, etc.. and that will send to our API https://hydra-kripton.herokuapp.com/model/?pm2=12&pm5=60&no=5&no2=100&nox=10&nh3=20&co=40&so2=23&o3=3&c6=21&tol=3&xy=2&aqi=40 these the example data and it will predict the air qulity and 
return data from it 
## Build With
* Android
* JAVA
* Python
* Flask
* Heroku
